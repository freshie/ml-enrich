    <name>Aaronic Priesthood</name>
    <desc>In the Church today, worthy male members may receive the Aaronic Priesthood beginning at
        age 12. These young men, typically ages 12â€“17, receive many opportunities to participate in
        sacred priesthood ordinances and give service. As they worthily fulfill their duties, they
        act in the name of the Lord to help others receive the blessings of the gospel.</desc>
