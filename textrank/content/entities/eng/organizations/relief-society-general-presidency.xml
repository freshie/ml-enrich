    <desc>The general presidency of the Relief Society consists of a president and two counselors.
        They spend much of their time traveling the world to visit, learn from, and teach the women
        of the Church. When they are not traveling, members of the presidency counsel with other
        Church leaders about strengthening the women of the Church and their families.</desc>
