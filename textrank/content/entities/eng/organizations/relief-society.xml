    <desc>All adult women in the Church are members of Relief Society. The Prophet Joseph Smith
        organized the Relief Society on March 17, 1842. He taught that the Relief Society was
        organized for “the relief of the poor, the destitute, the widow and the orphan, and for the
        exercise of all benevolent purposes.” In addition, he taught that the Relief Society was
        “not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls.” The larger part of the work of Relief
        Society today is “to look after the spiritual welfare and salvation … of all the female
        members of the Church.” The Relief Society was “divinely made, divinely authorized, divinely
        instituted, divinely ordained of God.” It operates under the direction of priesthood
        leaders.</desc>
