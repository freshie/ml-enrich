    <desc>Through the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood, Church leaders guide the Church and
        direct the preaching of the gospel throughout the world. In the ordinances of the
        Melchizedek Priesthood, “the power of godliness is manifest” (D&amp;C 84:20). This greater
        priesthood was given to Adam and has been on the earth whenever the Lord has revealed His
        gospel. It was taken from the earth during the Great Apostasy, but it was restored in 1829,
        when the Apostles Peter, James, and John conferred it upon Joseph Smith and Oliver
        Cowdery.</desc>
